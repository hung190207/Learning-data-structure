# Exercise

Design/ draw a road network with two points $a$ and $b$ such that the fastest route between $a$ and $b$ is not the shortest route.

# Solution

Imagine, there is a road from a to b, so of course the straight line from $a$ to $b$ is the shortest route.

Then, we draw a new road has curve shape $c$ between $a$ and $b$.

So now, if on the first road, there are 2-3 traffic lights or traffic jams, and we take more time to go from $a$ to $b$ than the other.

```
a ---------------- b
|                  |
| --------c--------|
```
