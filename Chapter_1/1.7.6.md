# Exercise
The set cover problem is as follows: given a set of subsets $S_1 , ..., S_m$ of the
universal set $U = {1, ..., n}$, ﬁnd the smallest subset of subsets $T ⊂ S$ such that
$∪_ti ∈ T_ti = U$ . For example, there are the following subsets, $S_1 = {1, 3, 5}$, $S_2 =
{2, 4}$, $S_3 = {1, 4}$, and $S_4 = {2, 5}$ The set cover would then be $S_1$ and $S_2$ .

Find a counterexample for the following algorithm: Select the largest subset for the
cover, and then delete all its elements from the universal set. Repeat by adding the
subset containing the largest number of uncovered elements until all are covered.

# Solution

We take $U = \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\}$

Then there are 5 subsets are: 
- $S_1 = \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\}$
- $S_2 = \{9\}$
- $S_3 = \{10\}$
- $S_4 = \{4,5,6,7,8,9,10\}$
- $S_5 = \{1,2,3\}$

So because $S_1$ is the largest subset, then the algorithm will pick it first and delete these elements from $U$.

Now $U$ becomes $U = \{9,10\}$. $S_4$ and $S_5$ do not contain elements in $U$, then they will be ignored.

Then the algorithm will pick $S_2$ and $S_3$ so result is $T = \{S_1,S_2,S_3\}$.

However, $T$ can be $=\{S_4,S_5\}$ too.

Therefore the algorithm failed to select the correct answer.
