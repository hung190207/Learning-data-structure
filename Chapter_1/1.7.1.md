# Exercise

Show that $ a + b $ can be less than *min(a,b)*.

# Solution

First, if we take **a** or **b** is the minimum number, then min(a,b) would be **a**, or **b**.

But there are exist negative number.

So if we take **a** or **b** is negative number then sum of two negative number would be a smaller number than either **a** or **b**.

For example:

    a = -5
    b = -3
    Then min(a,b) is -5
    a + b = -8
    and -8 always < -5
