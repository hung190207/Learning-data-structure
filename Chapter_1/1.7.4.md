# Exercise

Design/ draw a road network with two points $a$ and $b$ such that the shortest route between $a$ and $b$ is not the route with the fewest turns.

# Solution

This exercise have same method with the previous one. You just need to imagine these are two routes (these routes don't straight) and the fewest turns is the curve from $a$ to $b$, but the shortest can be 2-3 turns to go to the goal.
