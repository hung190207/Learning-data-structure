`# Exercise

Prove the correctness of the following algorithm for evaluating a
polynomial $P(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_1x + a_0$

```java
public int horner(int[] A, int x) {
    int p = A[A.length - 1];
    for (int i = A.length - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        p = p * x + A[i];
    }
    return p;
}
```

# Solution

I'll use Loop invariant method to prove it.

We take $A = \{1,2,3,4,5\}, \ x = 15$

## First iteration:

- p = 5
- After first iteration: $p = 5 * 15 + 4 = 79$

## Second iteration:

- p = 79
- After second iteration: $p = 79 * 15 + 3 = 1188$

## Third iteration:

- p = 1204
- After third iteration: $p = 1188 * 15 + 2 = 17822$

## Fourth iteration:

- p = 18063
- After fourth iteration: $p = 17822 * 15 + 1 = 267331$

Then the result of Loop invariant method is 267331. Let's check is it right

We have $P(15) = 5 \times 15^4 + 4\times15^3 + 3\times15^2 + 2\times15 + 1 = 267331$

Which is equal to the previous one.
