# Exercise

The *knapsack problem* is as follows: given a set of integers $S = \{s_1, s_2, ...,s_n\}$, and a target number $T$, find a subset of $S$ which adds up exactly to $T$. For example, there exist a subset within $S = \{ 1,2,5,9,10   \}$ that adds up to $T = 22$ but not $T=23$.

Find counterexamples to each of the following algorithms for the knapsack problem. That is, give an $S$ and $T$ where the algorithm does not find a solution which leaves the knapsack completely full, even though a full-knapsack solution exists.

(a) Put the elements of S in the knapsack in left to right order if they ﬁt, i.e. the
ﬁrst-ﬁt algorithm.

(b) Put the elements of S in the knapsack from smallest to largest, i.e. the best-ﬁt
algorithm.

(c) Put the elements of S in the knapsack from largest to smallest.

# Solution

There is example of each question:

Take $S = \{    1,2,3   \}, \ T = 5$.

(a)

| Subset of $S$ | Sum   |
|---------------|-------|
| {1}           | 1 < 5 |
| {1,2}         | 3 < 5 |
| {1,2,3}       | 6 < 5 |


(b)

| Subset of $S$ | Sum   |
|---------------|-------|
| {1}           | 1 < 5 |
| {1,2}         | 3 < 5 |
| {1,2,3}       | 6 < 5 |

(c) Take $S = \{    6,5,4   \}, \ T = 16$.

| Subset of $S$ | Sum     |
|---------------|---------|
| {6}           | 6 < 16  |
| {6,5}         | 11 < 16 |
| {6,5,4}       | 15 < 16 |
