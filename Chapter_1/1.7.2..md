# Exercise

Show that $a \times b$ can be less than *min(a,b)*.

# Solution

This kind of question very similar to the first one. And we use the same method to do that.

If min(a,b) can be **a** or **b**.

Then if there's exists one negative **a** or **b** then the product from **a** or **b** is less **a** or **b** times than min(a,b).

For example:

a = 5 
b = -2

Then the product of a and b is -10

which is less than min(a,b) is -2
